sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: If the array is already sorted, bubble sort will only do n iterations. The other algorithms will do more than that.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: Being the only n log n, and the others being n^2, then it should be the the one who takes less time to sort, as long as we use a random array.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: Takes the most time sorting an already sorted array.
