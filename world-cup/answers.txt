Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small number of predictions, we can't take the results at face value as they are heavily influenced by luck and so we must run the program more times to get more accurate results.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000 because the values seem to be the same after these many simulations
